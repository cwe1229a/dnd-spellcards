# DnD Spell Cards
React app 

 ## Purpose
 Practice with JS and React, and trying out Vite as a build tool.
 
 Creating a react app for Dungeons and Dragons players to have spell cards at hand on a mobile app to use in in-game sessions. This app will allow users to create 
 'collections' per character for any spell card they need in their campaign without having to carry physical copies of their spell cards. It will allow the user
 to find cards from searching by class, level, or school of magic.
